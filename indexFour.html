  <h1>Methods</h1>

  <p>Bryman & Bell (2011) wrote research methods can be and are associated with different kinds of research design. In this different kinds of research design, there are different frameworks which suited both to a certain set of criteria and to the
    research investigation. Bryman & Bell also described that there were five (5) prominent research designs being outlined:

  <ol type="1">

    <li>Experimental and related design such as the quasi-experiment;</li>
    <li>Cross-sectional design, the most common form of which is social survey research;</li>
    <li>Longitudinal design and its various forms, such as the panel study and cohort study;</li>
    <li>Case study design; and</li>
    <li>Comparative design</li>

  </ol>

  </p>

  <p>For this, the design is on the present study which is a longitudinal study. This study will focus to explain the connection between the economic output and the technological upheaval for small businesses in Kuala Lumpur in relation to time
    series data, which limit the analysis within Kuala Lumpur itself. Furthermore, it will enable to abstract from the small businesses heterogeneity, by which the comparative design and cross-sectional design are not feasible. Moreover, this study
    will enable to give further explanation on the effect of the technological upheaval to the small businesses. Apparently, with the limitation of the resources, collection of data in relation to small businesses in Kuala Lumpur with regard to the
    time-series will further give understanding on the link between the economic output and the technological upheaval in the short-run and long-run. The longitudinal design will be suitable to map the change from the technology with the economic
    output and causal factors over time.</p>

  <h2>Sampling and Sampling Procedures</h2>

  <p>As per Zikmund (2003), target population is a particular group of population that is relevant for this study which is the small businesses in Kuala Lumpur. Upon deciding, the questionnaire and the target population, the sampling is the final
    stage in research process before the data is collected. Sampling process refers to three (3) aspects as follows:

  <ul>

    <li>Sampling unit : Who is to be surveyed?</li>
    <li>Sampling size : How many small businesses should be surveyed?</li>
    <li>Sampling procedure : How should the respondents be chosen?</li>

  </ul>

  </p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the sampling frame is to be developed properly so that every small businesses in Kuala Lumpur or the target population has an equal or known chance of being sampled. As such, the target population and survey will be administered based on the cognitive characteristic in ensuring all small businesses have the equal chance or known chance of being sampled. The target population and survey will be administered based on the cognitive characteristic in ensuring all small businesses have the equal chances in participating in the studies. Large samples give more reliable results than small samples. However, it is not necessary to sample the entire target population or even substantiated portion to achieve reliable results. In determining the sampling, size follows Roscoe (1975) proposition of rules of thumb where sample sizes larger than thirty (30) and less than five hundred (500) are appropriate for research (Uma Sekaran, p. 295, 2003). The sample size chosen to conduct this study will be three hundred (300) respondents. In order to get a good and reliable three hundred respondents, a target of six hundred (600) questionnaires will be distributed to the small businesses. In achieving the objective of the study, obtaining a representative sample, a probability sample of the population should be drawn.</p>

<h2>Cobb-Douglas Production Function</h2>

<p>Cobb-Douglas function will be part of the process of the deduction to the research problem solving by reviewing the existing theory, where the hypothesis are tested afterwards based on the empirical findings. The relevant theories can be revised which state at the beginning of the research (Bryman & Bell, 2007). The Cobb-Douglas production function is a particular functional form of the production function widely used to represent the technological relationship between the amount of two or more inputs (particularly capital and labor) and the amount of output that can be produced. As mentioned earlier, the Cobb-Douglas production function contain the following:

<p class="formulaone">Y = AK<sup>&alpha;</sup>L<sup>&beta;</sup></p>

<p>where:</p>

<p>Y = total production (the real value of all goods produced in a year or 365.25 days)</p>
<p>L = labor input (the total number of person-hours worked in a year of 365.25 days)</p>
<p>K = capital input (a measure of all machinery, equipment and buildings, the value of capital input divided by the price of the capital)</p>
<p>A = total productivity</p>

<p>&alpha; and &beta; are the output elasticities of capital and labor, respectively. These values are constants determined by available technology. Output elasticity measures the responsiveness of output to change in levels of either labor or capital used in production, ceteris peribus. For example, if &alpha; equal to 0.45, a 1% increase in capital usage would be approximately a 0.45& increase output. (Wikipedia)</p>

<p>From the above, the data analysis and interpretation will apply the Python language as Python able to build mix statistic with image analysis, interpret large data sets and hypothesis testing. The content of the data analysis with richness of Python is:</p>

<p>Data representation:
  <ul>
    <li>Data as table</li>
    <li>The pandas data-frame</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>Hypothesis testing:
  <ul>
    <li>T-test : Simplest statistical test</li>
    <li>Paired test : Repeated measurement on the same individuals</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>Linear models, multiple factors, analyis of variance
  <ul>
    <li>formulas to specify statistical models in Python</li>
    <li>Multiple regression : including multiple factors</li>
    <li>Post-Hoc : hypothesis testing; analysis of variance (ANOVA)</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>More visualization : seaborn for statistical exploration
  <ul>
    <li>Pairplot : scatter matrices</li>
    <li>Implot : plotting a univariate regression</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>Testing for the interaction among the variables will be conducted further to inspect the association and the results produced by the testing.</p>
