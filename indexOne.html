    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p>Technology is a part of the factors of production. In economy, technology manages resources with durability which in turn creates perpetual accomplishment. This will have an influence towards the economy output. In conjunction of the economy output, the allocative efficiency by technology will determine the capital account of the small
      businesses. However, the manifestation of technology in the economic output will bring few variables associated with the former. Among the concerns are:
      <ul>
        <li>
          What is the severity of the technology adoption by small businesses in Kuala Lumpur?
        </li>
        <li>
          What is the determination of small businesses in Kuala Lumpur in enhancing their growth with the technology apparatus?
        </li>
        <li>
          What is the propensity (an inclination or natural tendency to behave in a particular way) towards preparation of itself on the challenges impart by technology?
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      The introduction of technology in the economic system will not restrict any small businesses to recognize its potential for the benefits gained amid the long-run average costs as the scale of output increases (economies of scale). Thus, extending the technology in the economic output is reflecting its ability to understand the above concerns.

      Additionally, the technological change and economy growth described by sciencedirect's website as:

    In a globalizing world economy, the reason for differences in economic growth and inter-country income inequality is explained on the grounds of technological differences. The goal of science and technology is to enable enterprises and individuals to use technologies more efficiently, as this results in reduced costs and enhanced productivity gains. The use of new technologies paves the way for production of new cheaper goods and for capital accumulation and, for that matter, for an enhanced international competitiveness of individual countries, as well as to an enhanced quality for scientific research institutions, while, on the other hand, contributing to cultural and political development of societies. The quality of growth rates is as much important as their size. One may ask the following questions in order to get a better understanding of whether growth has its reflections on people’s life or not: Are people involved and included in growth process? Does everybody enjoy the opportunities driven by growth? Do new technologies or trade volumes increase the choices facing people? Is welfare level of the future generations planned? Or, else, who is cared about is today’s generations only? Are markets accessible and open to everybody?

    <p>In the premise of the change in technology and economic growth, the small businesses in Kuala Lumpur are referring to definition with relation to  <a href="https://www.smeinfo.com.my/official-national-sme-definition" target="_blank">SME Corp Malaysia</a>:
      <ul>
        <li>Manufacturing : Sales turnover not exceeding RM50 million OR full-time employees not exceeding 200 workers.</li>
        <li>Services and other sectors : Sales turnover not exceeding RM20 million OR full-time employees not exceeding 75 workers.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Understandably, the externalities in reference towards the small businesses and technology will affect the perceive of the economic output. In most circumstances, the technical progress function is the attribute to the influence on the economic output with the application of the technology via the production equation (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technical-progress-function.asp#:~:text=The%20technical%20progress%20function%20(TPF,use%20of%20a%20regression%20model.)" target="_blank">Adam Hayes, 2019</a>).</p>
    <p>
      In this study, an examination of the factors involving the technological upheaval especially with the recent outbreak of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Malaysia" target="_blank">COVID-19</a> or any future state of distress or misery pushes the advance in the utilization of digital technology like Facebook, Twitter, E-Commerce or other electronic gainful method in communication be it social responsibility or businesses.
