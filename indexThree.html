    <h1>Literature Review</h1>

    <p>Studies on the correlation between technology advance and the economic output rely on the quick acceptance of small businesses to explicitly act on the window of opportunities and for forward development. Much literatures were existed discussing on the multi dimension of inclusion of digitalization in the micro and macro environment. A Technology Atlas Team (1987b) published and define technology of consisting elements: technoware (object-embodied technology), humanware (person-embodied technology), inforware (document-embodied technology) and orgaware (institution-embodied technology). Derived from these elements, Sharif (1986) discussed how the concept can help development in technology and economy which is sustainable at the national level and in-particular may influence small businesses. Continuously, technological competitiveness also influence the economic output. An insight of the technological competitiveness brought the substance of readiness and innovation for each property to form economic performance by stages in term of factor driven economy, efficiency driven economy, innovation driven economy (Schwab, 2009). Additionally, it also emphasizes on the institution, economic stability, health and primary education to make the technological competitiveness work.</p>

    <p>According to Technology Policy and Assessment Center at Georgia Institute of Technology [Roessner et al. (1992)], the technological competitiveness is basing on four (4) inputs of variables (national orientation, socio-economic infrastructure, technological infrastructure, and productive capacity) and three (3) output variables (technological standing, technological emphasize, and rate of  technological change) [Porter et al. (2001)] respectively. These input indicators incline to future technology-based competitiveness and output indicators evaluate the current competitiveness.</p>

    <p>Beside, economic geography demonstrates another relevant literature in adjusting the economic output with technology advance preparedness, for small businesses to be successful. However, studies have also been conducted to investigate whether technology advance has an effect on the productivity or provide advantages to improve the economic performance via the economic geography [Martin et al. (1993); Graham (2000)]. Yet, economic geography implicitly only determine the distinction of the apprehension in application of the technologies. This is understandably from the technology infrastructure as compare to some other areas beside Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia.</p>

  <p>The above literature reviews are accumulated to give insight on the relationship between the economic output and the technological change that would link the operation of small businesses with the selective consolidation (backshoring bit) especially in the e-commerce.</p>
