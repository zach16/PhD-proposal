  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Technology is central to regional change, positive and negative and to economic change, job-creating and job-destruction. It is must be obvious for cause and effect of the cumulative wealth of rich nations. Technology also promises more than any other phenomenon to bring poor nations out of poverty.</p>
    <footer>â€”Malecki 1997, pg.5</footer>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In correlation of the above, the technology creates another dimension that determine the successful of small businesses in Kuala Lumpur beside utilizing the conventional method in business dealing. Here, technology has become phenomenon in every aspect of life and especially, the progression and transformation of businesses. There will be more disruption in the economy with digitalization.</p>

  <p>Thus, the statement of problem will concern with understanding on the incorporation of technology for economy growth, to small businesses. This study will further examine the concept of technology advance whereby the adoption is the potent sources for growth in an economic output. The technology by no mean, is to be understood in the context of Cobb-Douglas production function, total factor productivity is captured by the variable A of which;
  </p>

  <p class="formula">Y = AL<sup>&alpha;</sup>K<sup>&beta;</sup></p>

  <p>The equation means Y is representing total output, K represents capital input, L represents labor input, and &alpha; and &beta; are the two inputs in respective of shares for the output. An increase in K or L will lead to an increase in output. However, due to the law of diminishing returns, the increased use of inputs may fail to yield increased output in the long run. The quantity of inputs does not completely determine the amount of output produced. How effective the factors of production are used is also important. Total productivity is less tangible than capital and labor inputs, and it can account for a range of factors, from technology, to human capital to organizational innovation.</p>

  <p>Total factor productivity can be used to measure competitiveness. The higher a business's total factor productivity, the more competitive it is likely to be (subject to constraint such as resources). It is generally viewed as one of the main vehicles for driving economic output and its growth. When a business is able to increase its total productivity, it can yield higher output with the same resources, and therefore drive economic growth. This also can be associated with the Production Possibility Frontier (PPF) which define an increase in technology that allows for greater output upon the same inputs can be described as an outward shift of the PPF (Boundless Economics - Inputs to Production - Labor, Natural Reasources and Technology, 2020).</p>

  <p><strong>Justification towards the study</strong> is broadened by the interaction between technology and economic output and augmented the inspirations in the profit bracket of the small businesses. It further develop again the justification to adopt excessive usage of tools associate with the technology advance, and shape how businesses affect the economic output. Categorically, the technology advance has been placed with Internet of Things (IoT) whereby Manyika et al. estimated a potential economic impact from the IoT to be $3,900 to $11,100 billion per annum (pa) in 2025, driven by: lower prices for hardware; advance computing; cloud storage; higher speed; and lower cost of connectivity; leading to an increasing number of machines and devices connected to the internet. It is also estimated and suggested that IoT will contribute approximately 4 to 11 percent of total world Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2025 (Edquist et al (2019)) (Retrieved from <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10438599.2019.1695941" target="_blank">The Internet of Things and economic growth in a panel countries</a>).</p>

  <p>Exogenous of the technological advance will enhance the understanding and its exploration on impact prevail from the IoT development. Some of the takeaways will be the competitiveness, enthusiasm, metamorphosis of abrupt change from the traditional conduct and technology sophistication.</p>

  <p>Thus, this study will utter requirement on the context of the economic output with the indicators of the technology difference which refer to:

    <ol type="1">

      <li>How the infrastructure of IoT's level affect the engagement by the small businesses in Kuala Lumpur?</li>
      <li>What are the factual penetration by the small businesses in Kuala Lumpur to the usage of the IoT?</li>
      <li>How footprint by digital empowerment in term of the technology variation and services to the small businesses in Kuala Lumpur?</li>

    </ol>

  </p>

  <p>The information will be determined by the econometric analysis in relation to the exertion of the composite indicators of the technology advance of:</p>

    <p>Information and Communication Technology (ICT) makes processes and communication within a businesses quicker and efficient.</p>
    <p>Research and Development (R&D) refers to the steps businesses in the innovation of new products, systems and services in respect of smartphones, tablets and multitude of applications and e-commerce, that widen the number of customers, lower cost of production and highly competitive.</p>
